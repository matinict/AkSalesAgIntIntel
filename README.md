A comprehensive Agentic Intelligence system built to provide deep, real-time sales analytics and generate prescriptive actions for Akij Resource. This project demonstrates expertise in constructing scalable, multi-agent architectures integrated with external workflow automation tools.

## ✨ Key Features (LLM Engineering Focus)

This system is built around a robust multi-agent architecture to perform complex data analysis and autonomously coordinate to deliver actionable insights.

 Multi-Agent Coordination: Implemented autonomous agents (e.g., Data Analyst Agent, Predictive Agent, Prescriptive Agent) using LangChain to break down complex queries and coordinate task execution.
 Full Analytical Framework: Executes a complete, four-stage analytical cycle in response to natural language queries:
    1.  Descriptive Analytics: What has happened? (Metrics, KPIs)
    2.  Diagnostic Analytics: Why did it happen? (Root Cause Analysis, Trend Comparison)
    3.  Predictive Analytics: What is likely to happen? (Forecasting, Risk Assessment)
    4.  Prescriptive Analytics: What actions should be taken? (Business Recommendations)
 Hierarchical Data Analysis: Structured data access and querying across multiple organizational layers:
     Product Category
     Customer Segment
     Region (Bangladesh Divisions)
     Sales Channel
 n8n Workflow Orchestration: Built-in capability to generate a structured JSON payload for immediate triggering of a downstream n8n workflow (e.g., sending high-priority alerts, creating CRM tasks).
 Interactive Conversational UI: A Streamlit-based chatbot interface (`chatbot_ui.py`) allowing non-technical users to access all agent capabilities via natural language.
