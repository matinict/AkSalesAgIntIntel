 
# Project Requirements: Multi-Agent Sales Intelligence System

## 1. Project Goal and Context

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate exceptional capability in **AI Agent** and **Agentic Intelligence** development. The solution must be centered on the domain of **sales data** to contribute to Akij Resource's digital transformation journey through intelligent automation and applied AI.

***

## 2. Core Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Data and Scope

The solution must be built around a **sales dataset** and must incorporate analysis across **multiple hierarchical layers**.

* **Primary Data Focus:** Sales Data.
* **Mandatory Hierarchical Layers (Examples):**
    * Product Category
    * Customer Segment
    * Region
    * Sales Channel
    * *Other relevant layers may be included.*

### 2.2 Analytical Frameworks (Four Pillars)

The solution must explicitly address and implement all four analytical frameworks. The multi-agent system should be capable of transitioning seamlessly between these stages in its reasoning process.

1.  **Descriptive Analytics:** **What has happened?** (Reporting key metrics, historical trends.)
2.  **Diagnostic Analytics:** **Why did it happen?** (Root cause analysis, identifying influencing factors.)
3.  **Predictive Analytics:** **What is likely to happen?** (Forecasting, probabilistic outcomes.)
4.  **Prescriptive Analytics:** **What actions should be taken?** (Generating concrete, actionable recommendations.)

***

## 3. Agentic Intelligence & Technical Implementation

The project is required to develop a comprehensive case study showcasing **Agentic Intelligence** by leveraging modern tools and architectures.

### 3.1 Mandatory Frameworks and Tools

| Framework/Tool | Purpose | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LangChain** | LLM-based reasoning and contextual intelligence. | Must be leveraged for structuring prompts, defining chains, or implementing reasoning loops. |
| **n8n** | Orchestration and Workflow Automation. | Must demonstrate capability to interact with or generate payloads for an n8n workflow (e.g., to trigger a follow-up task or alert). |
| **Multi-Agent Architecture** | Coordination and specialized task execution. | Must implement a multi-agent system for coordination between analytical and conversational agents. |

### 3.2 Strong Value Addition

* **Chatbot Interface / AI Assistant:** The inclusion of an interactive interface capable of interpreting natural language queries, responding with insights, and initiating actions based on those insights will be considered a **strong value addition**.

***

## 4. Submission Requirements

### 4.1 Project Deliverable Format

The project may be submitted in any suitable, functional format:

* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Python** scripts/application
* **Power BI dashboard** (with underlying data/code)
* **Interactive Prototype** (e.g., Streamlit, Flask app)

### 4.2 Timeline and Additional Documents

* **Submission Deadline:** **November 08, 2025**.
* **Previous Projects:** Submit **two** of your previously completed projects that explicitly demonstrate your experience with **AI Agent** and **Agentic Intelligence** frameworks.

### 4.3 Clarification

* Should any clarification regarding this brief be required, candidates are encouraged to reach out to the Akij Resource contact person.
