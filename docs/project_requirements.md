# **Project Brief: Multi-Agent Sales Intelligence System **

## **1. Project Objective**

Develop a next-generation **Multi-Agent Sales Intelligence System** that demonstrates advanced capabilities in **AI Agents**, **Agentic Intelligence**, and **data-driven decision automation**.
The system must use **Sales Data** as its core domain and support Akij Resource’s digital transformation by delivering insights, predictions, and intelligent actions.

---

## **2. Core Functional Requirements**

### **2.1 Data Scope**

The entire solution must revolve around a structured **sales dataset** and implement analysis across multiple hierarchical dimensions.

**Mandatory Analysis Dimensions (examples):**

* Product Category
* Customer Segment
* Region
* Sales Channel
* (Optional) Time Hierarchy, Salesperson Performance, Sub-Category, etc.

### **2.2 Analytical Intelligence Requirements (Four Pillars)**

Your multi-agent system must explicitly implement the following analytical stages and be capable of transitioning between them intelligently:

1. **Descriptive Analytics — “What happened?”**

   * KPIs, historical trends, comparisons.

2. **Diagnostic Analytics — “Why did it happen?”**

   * Root cause analysis, factor attribution, segment-level investigation.

3. **Predictive Analytics — “What will likely happen?”**

   * Forecasting, probability-based projections, expected risk/opportunity.

4. **Prescriptive Analytics — “What should we do next?”**

   * Concrete actions, strategic recommendations, operational playbooks.

## **3. Technical Requirements: Agentic Intelligence Architecture**

The project must demonstrate modern **agentic automation** using the tools listed below.

### **3.1 Mandatory Tools & Frameworks**

| Tool / Framework             | Purpose                                                    | Requirement                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **LangChain**                | LLM reasoning, prompt chaining, memory, and workflow logic | **Mandatory: Must be used** for at least one of these—prompt chains, reasoning loops, RAG, tools, or LLM orchestration   |
| **n8n**                      | Workflow automation and integration                        | **Mandatory: Must show a workflow or trigger interaction** (e.g., pushing insights, generating alerts, triggering tasks) |
| **Multi-Agent Architecture** | Specialized agents working collaboratively                 | **Mandatory: Must implement separate agents** for analytics, insight generation, and orchestration                       |

### **3.2 Strong Value Add (Bonus Points)**

A **chatbot/AI assistant interface** that can:

* Receive natural language queries
* Understand user intent
* Trigger the appropriate analytical agent
* Return insights or take automated action via n8n

This component significantly strengthens your proposal.

## **4. Submission Requirements**

### **4.1 Accepted Project Formats**

You may submit the final system in **any one** of the following formats:

* Jupyter Notebook
* Python scripts/application
* Power BI dashboard + underlying scripts
* Interactive Prototype (e.g., Streamlit, Flask, FastAPI)

Include **source code**, **documentation**, and **sample data** (synthetic or anonymized if needed).

### **4.2 Timeline & Additional Documents**

* **Submission Deadline:** **November 08, 2025**
* **Additional Requirement:**
  Include **two previous projects** demonstrating your hands-on experience with **AI Agents** or **Agentic Intelligence** (any tech stack).

### **4.3 Further Clarifications**

For any clarification about the brief, candidates should contact the designated Akij Resource representative.
